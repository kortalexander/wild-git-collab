```{r setup, include=TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
```

## STEP 5: No merge conflicts!

```{r partner 1}
### In this code chunk, start with the diamonds dataset (built in to
### ggplot2 package) and create a plot of price vs. carat (or some other
### variables of your choice)

ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = price, y = carat)) +
  geom_point()


```

```{r partner 2}
### In this code chunk, start with the diamonds dataset (built in to
### ggplot2 package) and create a subset based on filtering, e.g., 
### size greater than 1 carat or cut is "Ideal"
diamonds = diamonds %>% 
  filter(carat > 1 | cut == "Ideal")
```

## STEP 7: Uh oh, merge conflicts!

```{r break-it-1}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price)) + 
  geom_point()
# the above code plots the carats vs the price of diamonds
```

## STEP 11: And even more merge conflicts!

```{r break-it-2}
# Kort here again


```
